Graphics::PLPLOT
================

This module provides a wrapper around the C PLPLOT graphics library.
The PLPLOT library can be obtained from http://www.plplot.org.

This module should not be confused with the PDL::Graphics::PLPLOT
module written by Doug Hunt and distributed as part of PDL. If you 
have large data arrays to plot you should be using the PDL version.

If you have small data arrays and/or do not want a dependency on
PDL, this module is for you.

This software is currently in Alpha state since only a subset of the PLPLOT
functions are currently supported. More will be added as I need them.


Requirements
------------

C PLPLOT bindings from http://www.plplot.org. A C compiler is required
to build this module.

Tested with PLPLOT v5.3.0 on Linux and Mac OS X
Should work with Perl >= v5.005

Building
--------

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The tests include Perl versions of some of the C example code
distributed with PLPLOT itself.
